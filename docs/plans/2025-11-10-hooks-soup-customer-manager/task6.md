# Task 6: Monolithic JSX Rendering

**High-Level Behavior:** Build a massive single return statement (200+ lines of JSX) that contains all UI sections with inline styles, deeply nested conditionals, loading states for each cache layer, and no extracted subcomponents.

**Depends On:** All previous tasks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) - integrates all functionality including cache chaos into single render

**Provides To:** None (final integration)

**Subtasks:**
- 6.1: Build massive single return statement with all UI sections inline, cache status indicators
- 6.2: Add inline styling objects and ensure component exceeds 500+ lines with cache complexity

**Execution Flow:**
1. Execute 6.1 to create massive JSX structure showing data from potentially wrong cache
2. Execute 6.2 to add all inline styling, cache indicators, and push past 500 lines total
