# Task 4: CRUD Event Handlers

**High-Level Behavior:** Implement all event handlers for creating, updating, and deleting customers with validation, API calls, and state updates.

**Depends On:** Task 1 (apiService), Task 2 (validationService, storageService), Task 3 (state hooks)

**Provides To:** Task 5 (handlers for UI events)

**Subtasks:**
- **Task 4.1:** Implement add/create customer handlers
- **Task 4.2:** Implement edit/update customer handlers
- **Task 4.3:** Implement delete customer handler

**Execution Flow:**
These subtasks should be completed sequentially as they build on similar patterns and share error handling approaches.
