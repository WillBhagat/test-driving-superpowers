# Task 1: TypeScript Interfaces and Mock API Service

**High-Level Behavior:** Define the data contracts for the application and create a mock API service that simulates backend CRUD operations with realistic delays.

**Depends On:** None

**Provides To:** All other tasks (interfaces), Task 3 and Task 4 (API service)

**Subtasks:**
- **Task 1.1:** Define TypeScript interfaces (Customer, ValidationError, ApiResponse)
- **Task 1.2:** Implement mock API service with CRUD operations and simulated delays

**Execution Flow:**
1. Task 1.1 (interfaces) - must complete first
2. Task 1.2 (API service) - depends on interfaces from 1.1
